Intersection Management System
==============================

This project is intended for handle an intersection management system based on laser sensors (for now) and cameras (coming soon).

For now, it only uses a laserscanner data set from POSSI research group.

The aim is to have a representation of the scene based on data from different sensors and detect abnormal conditions and notificate traffic incidents.

This is part of my MSc project "Multisensor architecture for an intersection management system"
